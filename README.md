## 5. Loop Structure continued… 
 
A.  An automorphic number is the number which contained in last digit(s) of its square. Example 25 is an automorphic number as its square is 625 and 25 is present as the last two digits. Write a python script to print all automorphic numbers within range 11 to 100. 

B.  A number is said to be a special number, if the sum of the factorial of the digits of a number is same as the original number. Example-145 is a special number, because 1! + 4! + 5! =145. Write a python script to print all special numbers within range 100 to 999. 

C.  Write three separate python programs to generate the following patterns: 

D.  A composite magic number is positive integer which is composite as well as magic number. Composite number is a number that has more than two factors (For example 10, factors are 1, 2, 5, 10). A magic number is a number in which eventual sum of the digits is equals to 1(For example 28 = 2+8= 10=1+0=1). Write a python program which accepts two positive integer m and n, where m is less than n. Display the composite magic positive integers that are in range between m and n (both inclusive) and output them along with frequency. 
Example- m=10 and n=100 
Composite magic integers are 10, 28, 46, 55, 64, 82, 91, 100 
Frequency of composite magic integers is 8. 
 
E.  A circular prime number is a prime number that remains prime under cyclic shifts of digits. When the leftmost digit is removed and replaced at the end of remaining string of digits, the generated number is still prime. The process is repeated until the original number is reached again. A number is said to be prime if it has only two factors 1 and itself. Write a python program which will accept a positive number N and check whether it is a circular prime or not. The new numbers formed after shifting of digits should also be displayed. 
Example-  131 – 311 – 113 [131 is Circular Prime] 
			197 – 971 – 719 [197 is Circular Prime] 
			1193 – 1931 – 9311 -3119 [1193 is circular Prime] 
			29 – 92 [29 is not circular prime]

## 7. Concept of String Manipulation & User defined functions 
 
A.  Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters. 
Input Format: The first line of the input contains a statement. 
Output Format: Print the number of upper case and lower case respectively separated by a space. 
Example: 
Input: Hello world! 
Output: 1 9 
 
B.  Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized. 
Input Format: The first line of the input contains a number n which represents the number of line. From second line there are statements which has to be converted. Each statement comes in a new line. 
Output Format: Print statements with each word in capital letters. 
Example: 
Input: 1 
Hello world Practice makes perfect 
Output: HELLO WORLD PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT 
 
C.  Write a program that accepts a comma-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically. 
Input Format: The first line of input contains words separated by a comma. 
Output Format: Print the sorted words separated by a comma. 
Example: 
Input: without,hello,bag,world 
Output: bag,hello,without,world 
 
D.  Assuming  that  we  have  some  email  addresses  in  the  "username@companyname.com"  format,  please  write program to print the company name of a given email address. Both user names and company names are composed of letters only. 
Input Format: The first line of the input contains an email address. 
Output Format: Print the company name in single line. 
Example; 
Input: john@google.com 
Output: google 
 
E.  A string with parentheses is well bracketed if all parentheses are matched: every opening bracket has a matching closing  bracket  and  vice  versa.  Write  a  Python  function  wellbracketed(s)  that  takes  a  string  s  containing parentheses and returns True if s is well bracketed and False otherwise. 


Hint: Keep track of the nesting depth of brackets. Initially, the depth is 0. The depth increases with each 
opening bracket and decreases with each closing bracket. What are the constraints on the value of the nesting 
depth for the string to be well bracketed? 
 
Here are some examples to show how your function should work. 
>>> wellbracketed("22)")				False 
>>> wellbracketed("(a+b)(a-b)")			True 
>>> wellbracketed("(a(b+c)-d)((e+f)")	False 
 
F.  A positive integer m is a sum of squares if it can be written as k + l where k > 0, l > 0 and both k and l are perfect squares. Write a Python function sumofsquares(m) that takes an integer m returns True if m is a sum of squares and False otherwise. (If m is not positive, your function should return False.) 
 
Here are some examples to show how your function should work. 
>>> sumofsquares(41)	True 
>>> sumofsquares(30)	False 
>>> sumofsquares(17)	True 
 
 
G.  Given a string of odd length greater 7, return a string made of the middle three chars of a given String 
Original String is JhonDipPeta 
Middle three chars are Dip 
Original String is Jasonay 
Middle three chars are son 
Given 2 strings, s1 and s2, create a new string by appending s2 in the middle of s1. 
append Middle("Chrisdem", IamNewString) → "ChriIamNewStringsdem" 
 
H.  Using the lambda function find the largest among three numbers.






## 8. Concept of List, Tuple & Dictionaries 
 
A.  A two-dimensional matrix can be represented in Python row-wise, as a list of lists: each inner list represents one row of the matrix. For instance, the matrix 
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
 
Would  be  represented  as [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]].Write  a  Python  function matmult  (m1,m2) that  takes  as  input  two matrices using this row-wise representation and returns the matrix product m1*m2 using the same representation. You  may  assume  that  the  input  matrices  are  well-formed  and  have  compatible  dimensions. 
For instance: 
>>> matmult([[1,2],[3,4]],[[1,0],[0,1]]) 
[[1,2],[3,4]] 
>>> matmult([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]],[[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]) 
[[14, 32], [32, 77]] 
 
B.  Given a matrix M of MxN write a function snake that accepts a matrix M and returns a list which contains elements in the snake pattern of matrix M. (See the explanation to know what is snake pattern) 
 
Input 
A matrix M 
91 59 21 63 
81 39 56 8 
28 43 61 58 
51 82 45 57

Output 
[91, 59, 21, 63, 8, 56, 39, 81, 28, 43, 61, 58, 57, 45, 82, 51] 
 
Explanation: 
 
For row 1 elements are inserted from left to right 
For row 2 elements are inserted from right to left 
For row 3 elements are inserted form left to right 
and so on 
 
C.  A list rotation consists of taking the last element and moving it to the front. For instance, if we rotate the list [1,2,3,4,5], we get [5,1,2,3,4]. If we rotate it again, we get [4,5,1,2,3]. Write a Python function rotatelist(l,k) that takes a list l and a positive integer k and returns the list l after k rotations. If k is not positive, your function should return  l  unchanged.  Note  that  your  function  should  not  change  l  itself,  and  should  return  the  rotating  list. 
 
Here are some examples to show how your function should work. 
>>> rotatelist([1,2,3,4,5],1) 
[5, 1, 2, 3, 4] 
 >>> rotatelist([1,2,3,4,5],3) 
[3, 4, 5, 1, 2] 
 >>> rotatelist([1,2,3,4,5],12) 
[4, 5, 1, 2, 3] 
 
D.  Write a program that has a list of numbers (both positive as well as negative). Make a new tuple that has only positive values from this list. 
 
E.  Given a list L containing integers, write a program that creates and prints a dictionary 'd' containing all the numbers that occur twice or more in the list as keys and their indexes as values. Both the keys and their values should be in the same order as given in the list.
